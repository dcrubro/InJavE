# InJavE
A basic game engine written in Java using the LWJGL library.

## Requirements
**JDK 11** is required. If you don't have it you can download it from here: https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk11&jvmVariant=hotspot
To make sure that you are using the correct version of **JDK** open your **Command Prompt** or **Terminal** and type: ***java -version***, and if it says something like
***OpenJDK version 11.x.x*** you are good to go.

## How to edit
Load this as a project in **IntelliJ IDEA** (if it works you can use **eclipse** as well (or any IDE for that matter)).

## Building the project
The project uses **Gradle**. In a **BASH** shell (others work fine), navigate to the folder that you cloned the project into (or just copied the files) and run **./gradlew** (that should work).

## Using the engine
You can add your own ***scripts*** and ***assets*** and you can also edit the ***source*** (working on proper documentation soon).


## ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The ***"build"*** folder is usually not up-to-date. Build the project yourself to get it up-to-date.
