# InJavE
A basic game engine written in Java using the LWJGL library.

## Requirements
**JDK 11** is required. If you don't have it you can download it from here: https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk11&jvmVariant=hotspot

## How to edit
Load this as a project in **IntelliJ IDEA** (if it works you can use **eclipse** as well (or any IDE for that matter)).

## Building the project
The project uses **Gradle**. In a **BASH** shell (others work fine), navigate to the folder that you cloned the project into (or just copied the files) and run **./gradlew** (that should work).

## Using the engine
You can add your own ***scripts*** and ***assets*** and you can also edit the ***source*** (working on proper documentation soon).
